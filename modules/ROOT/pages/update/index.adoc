= Updating to a newer version
:description: This section describes the upgrade process from an earlier version of NOM.

It is recommended to always keep NOM up-to-date with the latest available version. 
You can update from any older NOM version to any newer version. 
A version downgrade is not possible. 
The natural order of NOM versions follows the *xref:../appendix/version-compatibility.adoc#versioning_scheme[semantic versioning scheme]*.
